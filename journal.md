Date: 1.30.2025 Subjet:SandBox
Today Peter Fuller came to talk us about Sandbox. It is a way to get your hands on a real project where you create a product and fully make it real and get it to people. You are also going to get credit for it while you are building your Start-up company where you can make money out of it while you are a student and create your own job. As well you will get in touch with inportant people in the tech world so you can get a job even if your start up attemps didnt work.

Today we learned how to desing diagrams for our programs with draw.io 
Circles: starts, stops and numbers for connecting to other pages.
Round boxes: steps, simple processes
Diamonds: decisision box, yes or no questions
Box with borders: complex or external processes, represented in detail in another diagram.

Date: 2.8.2025 Subjet: GitHub practice
I have been working on my own on mastering GitHub as I wanted to get my PC and my laptop all synced with my files and my projects to all my CS classes.
I still strugle when pushing and pulling because I sometimes mistake the branch I am using but I feel pretty good now.
Chat GPT has been very helpfull to gete stuff to work. In like a week I will recieve my new laptop so I want to have it all working properly. I find GitHub just an amazing tool.

Date: 2.11.2025 Subjet: Class Today About Presentations
Todays class has been super cool. Jeff told us so many good advice and tips to do better presentatins. He has done a magic trick that was crazy where he just made us pay so much attention to what he said because he proved us he knows what he is doing with that and gave a magic vibe to all the info he is giving us. He also told us about color meanings and emphasize stuff with size and location. He also tought us about conventions in presentations, cool powerpoint features and pictures tips that have a big impact in the viewers.

Date: 2.18.25 Subjet: In-class Presentation of Bet Brawl
Today we presented out slides about our project "Bet Brawl". Our app is all about a revolutionary betting website where we want it to have a competitive perspective so people want to compete to be the best gambler, it also will have a social/chat tab where you can have friends and also a leader board. We were very excited and people loved it. We were the first group in the class presenting so we had all the expectations on us but hopefuly we were prepared and everything went well. Then the rest of the class presented their presentations and it was great.

Date: 2.25.2025 Subjet: Missed class
Today I got a call from Spain, where I am from, that I could not miss right before class started, so I had to miss class. Instead I am going to talk about my week in other computer science classes. My week started great as Monday I had an exam for CS-2420 and I went very good. I also got the grade of the exam for CS-2100 I did las week Frideay and I got an 14/15 wich is great. Related to CD-2450, this week my team and I are planning to start writing some code about our project Bet Brawl. I really dont have much else to say but that I have to do cleaning checks today as I am an RA at Campus View Suits 1. Next thursday I will make sure to be in class so I can learn and enjoy the lessons from professor Jeff.

Date: 2.27.2025 Subjet: Pair Programming
Today we learned about pair programming. I did it with Bryson Francis and we worked on two issues. He played the driver role while doing a leaderboard and I guide him as the navigator. For mi yurn in the driver role we tryed to implement a self ban option in our betting project. We regularly changed roles and Bryson helped me a lot with understanding how the TinyDB database works. Chat GPT was helpfull as a resource to check that our code matcheed the format db database work as it is the first time working in something like that for some of us.

Date: 3.6.2025 Subject: Working in Self-ban
Today in class Jeff gave a lecture about thinking about how will we like the experience of the user be and the design of our page. 
After that, he told us to do a little meeting to talk about it and the rest of the class we spent codeing our project. I am currently working in the self ban aption. For now, i have the button showing up in the page and it also have a function. we still have to implement that when that button is used and you try to re log in it does not let you.

Date: 3.18.2025 Subject: Software Quality
The topic for today's class was quality in software. We saw that there is a huge spending just in fixing problems caused by bad quality software. There is a 300.000 jobs gap from companies wanting people to take the responsability to make good software. If you spend a little bit more money at the beggining to improve quality, you gain a huge benefit from it, but you also gotta be carefull not to spend to muhc because there is a point in which you start spending more money and getting less benefit.
Later, we learned how to make unit tests in our GUI for our project. Then we had some time to make our next assignment.

Date: 3.25.2025 Subject: Refactoring
In class we learned about refactoring and how does it affects the mainteinability, re-usability, preformance and the cost reduction. We disscussed how depending in the final purpose of the code we can sshape our code to adchieve it. In this game we play with readibility, efficiency and more to get the best code for our purpose.
Later I worked out some questions that I had about the Unit Test assignment and finally manage to understand properly what I was doing with all the Web code and Selenium.

Date: 4.3.2025 Subject: Automatization
today in class I was very tired so there was a bit part of it that unfortunately I fell sleep but I did pay attention for the most part and we takled for the most part about automatization in github actions. Basically what the assignment we whent through was about is making a script in github where when you push your progress to the online repository it runs your unit test from the previous assignment and tells your a report on what stuff when wrong. I think I messed up my unit test files while trying to transfer and merge everything so I got some issues but finally I did got the automization part done and submitted. Now I hav to work on getting all the problems the report is giving me to make my test work again.
